   ```

## Project Structure

```
src/
â”œâ”€â”€ components/        # React components
â”œâ”€â”€ services/         # Business logic and API services
â”œâ”€â”€ types/           # TypeScript type definitions
â””â”€â”€ data/            # Mock data for development
```

## Components

- `Dashboard`: Displays notification metrics and analytics
- `NotificationForm`: Form for sending new notifications
- `NotificationList`: Displays notifications with filtering
- `NotificationItem`: Individual notification display
- `UserSelect`: User selection dropdown
- `NotificationFilters`: Filter notifications by type

## Notification Types

## Notification Statuses

- Queued: Initial state when notification is created
- Sent: Notification has been processed and sent
- Delivered: Notification has been successfully delivered
- Failed: Delivery attempt failed
- Retry: Failed notification queued for retry (up to 3 attempts)

## Development

The project uses a simulated queue system to process notifications:

1. New notifications start in 'queued' status
2. Queue processor runs every 2 seconds
3. 80% success rate simulation for delivery
4. Failed notifications retry up to 3 times
5. Real-time status updates as notifications progress

## Build

To build for production:

```bash
npm run build
```
